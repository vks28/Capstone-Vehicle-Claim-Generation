## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Reference

This project uses a filtered subset of the [Car Damage Detection (CarDD) Dataset](https://cardd-ustc.github.io/).

- Only damage categories of **scratch** and **glass shatter** were selected.
- Captions were generated using LLaMA 3.2 and refined manually.
- The full dataset is publicly available via the above link.

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

Image quality was evaluated using:
- **FID Score**: Measures similarity between generated and real images.
- **Visual Assessment**: Human inspection for realism and damage accuracy.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Trained two expert LoRA models: one for scratches, another for glass damage.
- Evaluated the experts using FID metric.
- explored various methods to merge the two experts.
- Generated synthetic images based on descriptive captions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Snapshot

| Damage Type   | FID Score â†“ (Lower is better) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Scratch       | 206                        |
| Shattered Glass | 228                     |

## ðŸ§© Future Enhancements

- Merge multiple experts using dynamic Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques
- Improve captioning using multi-modal models like BLIP or GIT
- Explore style transfer to vary lighting, angle, and environment
